# Crystall cell visualization

This project is inspired by code I have written for an exercise sheet in university. I want to make the code easy to integrade into other projects, like for exmple adding some form of physics to it. The first stage of the project will be to give the lattice atoms and cells precise positions and use plotly to achieve different ways of simulating the resulting cells and atoms.

The long term prospects are, that I will write some form of physics engine, that is able to integrate with various projects, that simulate differend kinds of behaviour. Maybe shifting the calculations into C++ at some point, to recieve better performance. All these prospects are still written in the stars.
